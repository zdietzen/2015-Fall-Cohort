# Full Class - September 2015

## Welcome to Origin Code Academy

This repository contains the resources you'll need while taking this course. 

Currently there's a **Projects** folder and a **Lessons** folder. 

You'll find all the projects to be completed in the Projects folder. Each project will contain a readme file with the requirements for that project, and any materials that you'll need to complete it.

You'll find notes on topics covered for each day in the Lessons folder. I'll add to this folder at the end of each day with notes on the class and any external resources I may mention.

If you get stuck with a project outside of class or have any course related questions:

- Feel free to ask me or other students any questions in Slack
- Email me [(cameron@origincodeacademy.com)](mailto:cameron@origincodeacademy.com) or Jeff [(jeff@origincodeacademy.com](mailto:jeff@origincodeacademy.com)

Cheers,

##### Cameron
