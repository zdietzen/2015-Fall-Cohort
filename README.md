# Full Class - September 2015

## Welcome to Origin Code Academy

This repository contains the resources you'll need while taking this course. 

Currently there's a **Projects** folder and a **Lessons** folder. 

In the Projects folder, you'll find subfolders for each project to be completed. Each subfolder will contain a text file with the requirements for that project, and any materials that you'll need to get that project off the ground.
I'll be adding a subfolder to the Lessons folder every day, with a text file containing a summary of the topics we discussed.

If you get stuck with a project outside of class or have any course related questions:

- Feel free to ask me or other students any questions in Slack
- Email me [(cameron@origincodeacademy.com)](mailto:cameron@origincodeacademy.com) or Jeff [(jeff@origincodeacademy.com](mailto:jeff@origincodeacademy.com)

Cheers,

##### Cameron
