# Before you get here

## Requirements

### You need to bring a laptop.
Most of the course will involve building programs on your own computer. You won't get anything out of the course without a laptop.

### Your laptop should be able to run Windows.
As you will be learning how to use the .NET framework provided by Microsoft to build programs, your laptop will need to be able to run Windows.  
(**Note**: While it is possible to write and compile code for the .NET framework on OSX and various Linux distributions - we will be focused on teaching only in Windows. I want to encourage students helping eachother, and having everybody use Windows helps achieve that goal.) 

Don't worry - if you don't have Windows, we can give you a copy through our BizSpark subscription.

If you are bringing a MacBook - there are several ways you can get Windows running on your laptop. I personally recommend using [Parallels Desktop ($79.99)](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) or [VirtualBox (Free)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to create a Windows virtual machine on your Mac.
 I highly recommend this over doing something like BootCamp as it is less risky to setup virtual machines than it is to repartition your hard drive.
