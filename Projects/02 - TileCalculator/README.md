# Tile Calculator
You have been contracted by a local tiling startup to write an app that they can use to create quotes for tiling square rooms.  

After negotiating an exorbitant hourly rate for your services, I have uncovered that they would like a console application that asks the following questions..   

```
1. What is the width of the room? (ft): 10
2. What is the height of the room? (ft): 10
3. How big is the tile? (ft2): 1
4. How much per tile? ($): 0.50
```

And outputs the following
```
Area to tile: 100ft2
Required # of tiles: 100
--
Total cost: $50.00
```
Your 

For example:
```
What is your birthday? (Enter date in format MM/DD/YYYY): 10/12/1989

You are 25 years, 49 weeks and 2 days old. 
```
